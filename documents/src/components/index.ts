 * Molecules: Molecules are combinations of atoms that work together as a single unit. For example, a search bar can be formed by combining a form label, an input field, and a button. Molecules take on properties from the atoms that comprise them but function as more complex and interactive elements.
 * Organisms: Organisms are groups of molecules that create distinct sections of an interface. They represent more complex components, such as a navigation bar or a product card. Organisms can be reused across different parts of a product to maintain consistency and enhance functionality.
 * Templates: Templates provide the structural framework for pages. They combine organisms into a layout, demonstrating how different components fit together without specific content. Templates focus on the overall structure and layout of a page.
 * Pages: Pages are specific instances of templates filled with real content. They represent what the user actually sees, showcasing the final product with all design elements and content in place. Pages are where all components come together to form a complete, functional interface.
